This repo have two files:
     inventory.py
     test_inventory.py

Here, I used Test Driven Development (TDD) to build a Python terminal inventory management system using the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.

The significance of TDD:

     -It ensure the software quality.
     
     -Reduce the time for debugging.
     
     -Enforces developer to outline all the requirements in detail prior to implementation,resulting in clearer code design.
     
Functionalites are:

    -add_item, enable the administrator to add new goods and their prices to the inventory records
    
    -update_item_price, grant functionality to set a new price of a product as prices changes overtime.
    
    -delete_item, allows to remove a product form the inventory records.
    
    -inventory_summary - you can have an overview of all the products,their pricing and total revenue.
